Modified ElGamal Cryptosystem Algorithm
The project Modified ElGamal Cryptosystem Algorithm divides the private key into 2n+1 parts ,that is odd number of parts so that even if the intruder is able to detect some of the parts of the private key, it is computationally infeasible to detect all the 2n+1 parts. At present, the Elgamal encryption algorithm works by sending data to the receiver who has just one private key to decrypt the data. But in this algorithm, as there is just one private key, it can be guessed by any intruder and is thus not reliable. With the need to protect the integrity and privacy of information belonging to individuals and organizations, we have developed this system, this topic was chosen so as to unable the intruder identify the message even if he succeeds in calculating one of the private keys because the calculation of all 2n+1 parts of the private key is a difficult task. This project aims at converting the plaintext into a form unreadable by unauthorized people and hence can be readily transferred across the web and decrypted at the recipient side only by authorized people. It provides an interactive environment to encrypt, decrypt or transfer encrypted files without compromising with the integrity and privacy of critical information .In the era of wide area, open distributed systems, this system will help resolve various security issues.
